We propose a Dual-Stream Attention Deepfake Detection Model (SADM) that integrates:
1. Frequency Stream: Hybrid wavelet-based multi-level feature extraction .
2. Spatial Stream: Xception backbone for spatial feature extraction.
3. Dual-Stream Attention Fusion: A novel bidirectional attention mechanism that adaptively fuses spatial and frequency-domain features.
